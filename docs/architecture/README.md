## Components

### Feature Store
- **Registry**: Manages feature metadata and versioning
- **Online Store**: Redis-based fast access storage
- **Offline Store**: SQLite-based historical storage
- **Feature Pipeline**: Feature computation and validation

### ML Pipeline
- Model training and evaluation
- Model versioning and registry
- Batch and online prediction
- Model monitoring and drift detection

### API Layer
- RESTful endpoints for predictions
- Feature management endpoints
- Monitoring endpoints
- Health checks and metrics

### Monitoring
- Model performance metrics
- Feature drift detection
- System metrics
- Request/response logging

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes deployment
- Auto-scaling
- Load balancing
- Service mesh integration

## Data Flow
1. Feature computation and storage
2. Model training and deployment
3. Online prediction flow
4. Monitoring and feedback loop

## Security
- API authentication
- Rate limiting
- Network policies
- Secret management

## Scalability
- Horizontal scaling
- Caching strategy
- Database optimization
- Resource management
